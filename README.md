# SuperDARN_reanalysis_parser
Code which accompanies a published dataset of dominant spatial and temporal patterns of horizontal ionospheric plasma velocity variation covering the northern polar region, from 1997.0 to 2009.0.
The program 'Data_Loading_Demonstration_for_HybridPlasmaVelocityModes.m' demonstrates how to reconstruct the reanalysis data from the contributing models, for a given month.

The dataset, and a detailed description of its metadata and how it was made, are available at this DOI: [will be included once the dataset is published].
